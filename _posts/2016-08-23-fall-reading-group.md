In the fall term, the CS education reading group is meeting at UTM at 4:00 on Mondays and on skype, and we welcome your participation. We are reading papers from ICER, and students at all levels are welcome. The group may be of particular interest to students who are looking to get involved in research at U of T (whether or not that research is in computing education), but even if you aren't thinking of graduate school, this is an opportunity to practice close reading of technical material and to get a glimpse of what research is like.
