abstract = {Motivation: In computing, Impostor Phenomenon (IP) has been viewed as a problem for many years, but little research has been done to show its prevalence. In 2020, IP in computing began to be explored at single institutions [68]. The results showed that IP is prevalent among undergraduate and graduate students in computing courses and that the rates of IP are higher for women. In 2022, these results were reaffirmed with a replication study including two institutions [82]. This is concerning due to the negative effects correlated with people who experience IP such as low self-esteem [19, 37] and anxiety [21, 38].Objectives: This study aims to replicate these previous findings at a considerably larger scale to determine whether similar results are observed across institutions. To support future work, we conduct an exploratory analysis of student demographics, course factors, and institutional factors to gain insight into factors that may be associated with higher levels of IP among students.Methods: A survey consisting of Clance's IP scale (CIPS) and questions on students’ demographic and background information was given at 18 institutions. Higher CIPS scores indicate more IP experiences. Differences in CIPS scores were analyzed based on students’ demographics and background information (gender, race/ethnicity, transfer status, and chosen degree program), course factors (introductory computing courses vs. non-introductory computing courses, upper- vs. lower-division), and institutional factors (size of the institution, public vs. private, teaching- vs. research-centric).Results: Our results are consistent with previous findings that IP is prevalent among students in computing courses and that women have significantly higher CIPS scores of IP than men in computing, and that traditionally marginalized race/ethnicity status in computing and chosen degree program do not have an observable impact.In terms of course factors, we do not see a difference in scores based on whether students are enrolled in a lower- or upper-division course. We see that students enrolled in introductory computing (CS1) courses have statistically significant higher scores than students outside of CS1 courses.In terms of institutional factors, students in computing courses at public institutions have statistically significantly higher scores than students at private institutions. Students at medium-sized institutions have statistically significantly higher scores than students at small or large institutions. We do not find any difference based on whether an institution is teaching- or research-centric.Discussion: These results suggest that IP is prevalent in computing courses across the entire curriculum and across different types of institutions. Differences in demographic groups are consistent with prior work in computing, specifically higher rates among women, suggesting IP may be worth further inquiry as a potential factor in the gender participation gap in computing.},

abstract = {Sense of belonging has been shown to be important for student persistence and success in computer science. A student's sense of belonging is related to a variety of factors, including gender, prior programming experience, first generation status, and elements of the learning environment. Prior work has also shown that competitive admission processes have a negative impact on student sense of belonging. This paper explores sense of belonging of students who enter a computer science major through either a direct or competitive admission pathway. We look at how admission pathway, prior programming experience, and self-identification as a minority in computer science affect sense of belonging for these students. We find that sense of belonging does not differ in a significant way between admission pathways, however prior experience and self-identification as a minority do affect sense of belonging.},

abstract = {Computer science courses employ a variety of assignment deadline policies ranging from strict policies where no late submissions are accepted to flexible policies where extensions, sometimes lengthy ones, are permitted without grade penalty. Many instructors have moved towards increased flexibility for students to alleviate pressure, help students succeed, and better manage the administrative burden of granting extensions. Using data from eight offerings of three computer science courses, we compare assignment submission rates and times as well as course outcomes under different deadline policies. We also compare how similar deadline policies were used by students in different courses, including first- and upper-year courses.Unsurprisingly, more students submitted assignments late when there was no grade penalty. However, we found that many students did not take advantage of or maximize the opportunity to submit late even when given the opportunity to do so without penalty. For those who do submit late, we found a negative correlation between how late the assignment was submitted and the assignment grade for courses using grade penalty deadline policies, but not for the policies that allowed late submission without grade penalty. We also found a higher rate of individual requests for extensions outside the policy in courses using a grade penalty policy.},

Through analysis of open-ended survey responses from over 1,300 students, we have gained a more nuanced understanding of these factors. We observed three categories of factors: workload and time management, optimizing learning and assignment marks, and social and affective factors. We identified two modifiers, online learning and previous group experiences, that amplify the impact of factors in the three main categories. We highlight notable student quotations and discuss barriers to group formation.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of allowing students to optionally work in small groups on problem sets in first- and second-year computer science theory courses. After each homework assignment, students reported on their experience working on that problem set either individually or in a group of two or three. Over 1,300 students from two courses participated. We explore who chooses to work in a group and why, how students work in groups, and differences in learning, drop-rates, help-seeking, and satisfaction with problem set submissions between groups and students working individually.  Students reported that workload and problem set marks were key factors for choosing to work in groups. Students in groups were less likely to drop the course, less likely to seek help from unsanctioned sources, less likely to leave problems unanswered, and more satisfied with their submissions. Students working in groups had much higher average grades for problem sets and similar grades on tests. On individual tests, we observed lower grades for students who reported either doing less than their fair share overall or allowing their partner to do most of the work on particular questions. Final course grades were higher for students who worked in groups, even when controlling for prerequisite grades.},

abstract = {As with many other institutions, there is currently far more student interest in our undergraduate Computer Science major than we can accommodate. Our institution limits the capacity of the Computer Science major and uses a competitive, grades-based admission process for students to gain admission at the end of their first year of study. This competitive admission process has had a notable negative impact on the student experience in first-year, as students are especially driven to earn top grades. The competition also encourages students to prioritize academics over everything else.Although we are taking measures to improve the first-year experience, this competitive, grades-focused culture is still at risk of carrying forward into the subsequent years of our major. This is an issue on top of more widespread challenges faced by many CS programs in retaining students through to graduation. To improve the student experience of those admitted to a Computer Science major, we developed the Second-year Learning Community (SLC) program. This co-curricular program aims to foster a sense of community, and connect students to their peers and to other members of our academic and local tech communities.We report on our experience developing and offering the SLC program, including our program curriculum, and resources required. We also share feedback from participants, and outline lessons learned. Overall, the program was well-received by student participants, as well as by student and faculty mentors. It is a relatively low-cost initiative, and its success in Computer Science has led to expansion to nine other departments.},
