abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has become increasingly important for students, yet university-level ML courses are often perceived as challenging and time-intensive. This study explores the perceived challenges and motivations of students in a university ML course to inform curricular and teaching strategies. Through 5 surveys conducted in two instances of a 12-week introductory ML course, we examined students' engagement with both theoretical and practical aspects of ML. Results indicate that while students initially express strong interest in applying ML concepts, their reported interests can shift toward theoretical foundations. Challenges in both theory and practice are reported, including difficulties in mathematical notation and vectorization of gradient components, as well as model implementation. Students also discuss the time commitment required in a course with both theoretical and practical content. We recommend aligning course content with student motivations, providing targeted support for mathematical notation and vectorization, and balancing theoretical depth with practical application.},

abstract = {Undergraduate computer science programs worldwide struggle to attract and retain underrepresented students for many reasons. Culture, stereotype threats, uneven gender and racial representations, lack of role models, and uncertain career prospects for minority groups are among the many reasons behind this situation. Many computer science programs are trying to change course through strategies to foster equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), aimed at improving outreach, recruitment, admissions, and retention of underrepresented students. EDI approaches may also include modifications to the undergraduate computer science curriculum. However, if not properly planned, these modifications risk amplifying existing stereotypes rather than producing positive change [38]. In this study, through an extensive literature review, a rigorous curriculum analysis of 49 computer science programs across the globe, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of surveys and interviews bringing in the voices of 613 students and 30 educators participating from around the world, we explore equity, diversity, and inclusion in the computer science curriculum. We highlight the role of inclusive content and course design, discuss program flexibility, and the impact of inclusive courses and program design in attracting and retaining historically marginalized students. Finally, we provide concrete steps to make computing science undergraduate curricula more appealing to a diverse audience.},
