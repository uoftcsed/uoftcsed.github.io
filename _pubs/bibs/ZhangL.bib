abstract = {Faculty and industry practitioners recognize written communication to be important in computer science, but it can be challenging to convince students of the same. As student perceptions are molded early in a program of study, we focus on early-year CS students to understand their perceptions towards the importance of writing in CS, with the goal of framing discipline-specific writing pedagogy. We qualitatively analyze responses from first and second-year CS students in a survey about the role of writing in their field. The responses reveal that a majority view writing as an indispensable skill. Specifically, students recognize it as a fundamental skill, applicable across diverse contexts, and uniquely relevant in CS compared to other fields. We identified 4 perceptions that they hold which are helpful to their development as writers: that writing is a useful fundamental skill, which is useful for achieving various goals in a variety of contexts, and that writing in CS is different than in other fields. However, 20\% of responses include reasons why writing is not important in CS, and we identify 4 perceptions harmful to students' development as writers: that writing skills can be avoided, are defined narrowly, do not need to be developed beyond a baseline, and come at the cost of computing skills. We believe that there is an opportunity to align discipline-specific writing instruction with these useful and harmful perceptions.},

abstract = {While machine learning (ML) has proved impactful in many disciplines, design decisions involved in building ML models are difficult for novices to make, and mistakes can cause harm. Prior work by Skripchuk et&nbsp;al. [35] identified common errors made by ML students via qualitative analysis of open-ended ML assessments, but their sample was limited to a single institution, course, and assessment setting. Our work is an extended, conceptual replication of this work to understand the common errors made by machine learning students. We use a mixed-method approach to analyze errors in 30 final project reports in an undergraduate machine learning course. The final reports describe the model-building process for a classification task, where students build models on a complex data set with numerical, categorical, ordinal and text features. Our choice to analyze project reports (rather than code) allows us to uncover design errors via how students justify their methodology. Our project task is to achieve the best test accuracy on an unseen test set; thus, as a way to validate these common errors, we identify the association between these errors and the model’s test accuracy performance. Common errors we find include those consistent with Skripchuk et&nbsp;al. [35], for example issues with data processing, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection. In addition, our focus on design error exposes other common errors, for example where students use certain kinds of features (e.g., bag of words representations) only with particular models (e.g., Naive Bayes). We call these latter types of errors model misconceptions, and such errors are associated with lower test accuracy. Some of these errors are also present in work by practitioners. Others reflect a difficulty by students to make correct connections between ML concepts and achieve the relational level of the SOLO taxonomy. We identify areas of opportunity to improve machine learning pedagogy, particularly related to data processing, data leakage, hyperparameters, nonsensical outputs, and disentangling data decisions from model decisions.},

abstract = {Despite continued efforts to further the participation of women in Computer Science (CS), progress has been limited during the past decades. Recent efforts have been focused on recruitment and retention, with a notable gap in exploring the impact of admissions processes on diversity and inclusion. Through an extensive literature review, contextual analysis of public admissions data from 40 universities across four regions around the world, and qualitative and quantitative analysis on surveys and interviews, we explored the role of admissions in enhancing diversity and inclusion in CS undergraduate programs. Our findings highlight the role of financials, the possible positive effects of explicit advocacy for diversity and inclusion, and the imperative to cultivate a more welcoming and inclusive culture in CS programs.},

abstract = {Recent work has confirmed that computing students experience the Imposter Phenomenon (IP) at higher rates than reported in other disciplines. However, no work has examined what aspects of the university computing experience might lead to a higher rate of IP experiences. We aim to illustrate the IP experiences students have, identify common sources of these experiences, and document the effects of these experiences and how students respond to them. We asked undergraduate students to share recent experiences that illustrate their experiences with the IP. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on these open-ended responses, resulting in a set of inter-connected themes. A significant fraction of students related stories about making comparisons with peers or observing peer behaviour that made them question their abilities. Students also spoke about holding unrealistic expectations learned from their peers or imposed by the environment. These experiences may be particularly acute for minority-affiliated students who may come to feel they do not belong. Ultimately, these IP experiences can lead to a loss of motivation or a cycle of failure that leads students to leave computing. The central role social comparisons play in IP experiences suggests that it is particularly important to foster communities where opportunities for comparison are reduced and where realistic expectations are explicitly set.},

abstract="We propose and evaluate a question-answering system that uses decomposed prompting to classify and answer student questions on a course discussion board. Our system uses a large language model (LLM) to classify questions into one of four types: conceptual, homework, logistics, and not answerable. This enables us to employ a different strategy for answering questions that fall under different types. Using a variant of GPT-3, we achieve 81{\%} classification accuracy. We discuss our system's performance on answering conceptual questions from a machine learning course and various failure modes.",

abstract = {Writing skills are often considered unimportant by computer science students and were under-emphasized in our curriculum. We describe our experience embedding CS-specific writing instruction at scale in most of our large, core, first- and second-year Computer Science courses, each with 300-800+ students. Our approach is to collaborate with a writing specialist and a community of course instructors, centralize the management of writing teaching assistants, and introduce a variety of relevant genres and contexts to help students develop and apply writing skills. We outline the institutional support and organization crucial to a project of this scale. In addition, we report on a survey collecting student perception of the writing instruction/assessment. We reflect on quantitative and qualitative evidence of success, as well as the challenges that we faced. We believe that many of these challenges will be common across institutions, particularly those with large courses.},

abstract = {This study analyzes common issues in the writing of our upper-year, undergraduate computer science students in timed (e.g. tests) and untimed (e.g. longer assignment reports) scenarios. Our goal is to identify writing issues that should be addressed earlier in the CS curriculum. In collaboration with a writing specialist, we develop and fine-tune a rubric with Grammar, Conciseness, Clarity, Organization, Structure, and Formality as the main categories.  We find, in our writing samples, that grammatical issues (such as punctuation errors or run-on sentences) are common even in a setting where students have ample time to proofread. Other common issues include unclear pronoun antecedents, lacking topic sentences, and other structural and organizational issues. Moreover, we correlate the presence of these issues with the students' grades. We do not find statistically significant correlations between writing skill and grades, and the weak correlations we find depend heavily on the writing context.  We hope that our rubric items and findings are useful for instructors in targeting writing skills that warrant development.},

abstract = {Motivation Despite the widespread belief that computing practitioners frequently experience the Imposter Phenomenon (IP), little formal work has measured the prevalence of IP in the computing community despite its negative effect on achievement.Objectives This study aims to replicate recent work that has suggested that IP experiences are widespread in computing students and to extend that work by exploring the relationship between the IP, progress in the program, and ethnic identity.Methods A survey with several demographic questions (gender, ethnicity, international status, and year of study) and Clance's IP scale (CIPS) was deployed to students in post-secondary computing courses. Correlations between demographic factors and CIPS scores were evaluated, and a linear model was constructed to explore the interaction between demographic factors of interest.Results We reaffirm that a high proportion of CS students meet the IP diagnostic criteria and that women report higher CIPS scores than men. We also present evidence that Asian students with domestic and international status report different levels of IP experiences.Discussion These findings highlight the importance – to educators at all levels – of cultivating belonging in computing communities.},
