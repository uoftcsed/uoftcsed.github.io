abstract = {In 2017, Edwards et al. studied a large corpus of Java programs collected through an automated submission and assessment system that integrated static analysis feedback. They found that errors reported were most commonly related to formatting, but that the frequency of errors they categorized as "Coding Flaws" correlated with program correctness grades. They argued that static analysis feedback could detect problems relating to code correctness and could therefore be useful beyond evaluating conformance to style rules, but that students may overlook non-cosmetic error messages because of the relative volume of formatting errors. In this paper we perform a conceptual replication of the Edwards et al. study with 1270 CS1 students learning Python. We confirm that almost a decade later and even after being instructed to use the auto-formatting options within their IDE, students still encounter mostly formatting errors when using a static analysis tool. We find that the second- most common category of errors detected are "Coding Flaws", and, like Edwards et al., that the frequency of coding flaws identified by the static analysis tool correlates to program correctness. When we examine trends based on levels of prior programming experience, we find that all students tend to make more formatting errors than other kinds of errors, but that students with no prior programming experience have more errors reported across all error categories.},

abstract = {Many university courses are moving from traditional paper-based assessments to computer-based tests with automated grading. This change could lead to increased student test anxiety but because the ease of grading facilitates frequent smaller-stakes assessments, it may reduce test anxiety particularly over the course of a semester as students become familiar with the test platform. This study examines the roles of test anxiety, self-efficacy, and academic performance, leveraging an in-person, supervised, computer-based testing approach. We measure each of these variables for 173 CS1 students over five unit quizzes and one final exam. We find no significant correlation between test anxiety and performance for the men or the women, while self-efficacy correlates moderately with performance for the men. Despite higher anxiety and lower self-efficacy, the women achieved comparable academic outcomes to the men. These results challenge traditional views on the impact of test anxiety on academic performance, highlighting the need for deeper investigation into these phenomena.},

abstract = {Timely, personalized feedback is essential for students learning programming. LLM-powered tools like ChatGPT offer instant support, but reveal direct answers with code, which may hinder deep conceptual engagement. We developed CodeAid, an LLM-powered programming assistant delivering helpful, technically correct responses, without revealing code solutions. CodeAid answers conceptual questions, generates pseudo-code with line-by-line explanations, and annotates student’s incorrect code with fix suggestions. We deployed CodeAid in a programming class of 700 students for a 12-week semester. A thematic analysis of 8,000 usages of CodeAid was performed, further enriched by weekly surveys, and 22 student interviews. We then interviewed eight programming educators to gain further insights. Our findings reveal four design considerations for future educational AI assistants: D1) exploiting AI’s unique benefits; D2) simplifying query formulation while promoting cognitive engagement; D3) avoiding direct responses while encouraging motivated learning; and D4) maintaining transparency and control for students to asses and steer AI responses.},

Through analysis of open-ended survey responses from over 1,300 students, we have gained a more nuanced understanding of these factors. We observed three categories of factors: workload and time management, optimizing learning and assignment marks, and social and affective factors. We identified two modifiers, online learning and previous group experiences, that amplify the impact of factors in the three main categories. We highlight notable student quotations and discuss barriers to group formation.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of allowing students to optionally work in small groups on problem sets in first- and second-year computer science theory courses. After each homework assignment, students reported on their experience working on that problem set either individually or in a group of two or three. Over 1,300 students from two courses participated. We explore who chooses to work in a group and why, how students work in groups, and differences in learning, drop-rates, help-seeking, and satisfaction with problem set submissions between groups and students working individually.  Students reported that workload and problem set marks were key factors for choosing to work in groups. Students in groups were less likely to drop the course, less likely to seek help from unsanctioned sources, less likely to leave problems unanswered, and more satisfied with their submissions. Students working in groups had much higher average grades for problem sets and similar grades on tests. On individual tests, we observed lower grades for students who reported either doing less than their fair share overall or allowing their partner to do most of the work on particular questions. Final course grades were higher for students who worked in groups, even when controlling for prerequisite grades.},
