abstract = {There is a wealth of evidence that involving undergraduate students in research has positive impacts in a variety of areas, from representation and retention to outcomes and self-efficacy. However, developing and growing an undergraduate research program can be daunting, especially for institutions that do not have a large existing research enterprise. In this work, we detail a program that revolves around student-developed literature maps to help students gain the ability to read and assess research papers in a way that is accessible, robust, and requires relatively little faculty overhead. We further detail how this program has been run through 4 iterations, with a total of 47 students producing 5 posters or short papers, and 3 full papers. In this work, we provide our experiences using literature mapping projects to boot-strap an undergraduate research program and provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of the students who have participated. All of the materials, including sample spreadsheets, and scripts to generate LaTeX tables and figures are included for anyone wishing to undertake a literature mapping project of their own.},

abstract = {With the recent growth in popularity of alternative evaluation methods, two methodologies have become particularly prevalent in CS education literature: Specifications grading and contract grading. Recent work has shown that these novel evaluation approaches can have positive impacts in the classroom and lead to more equitable outcomes for students. However, there is not yet a consensus on terminology, implementation details and best practices. In this work, we review the literature on the use of specifications and contract grading in CS education. We find that while there is a good deal of promising research, there is a great deal of variation in methodologies and a sparsity of evaluation of the efficacy of learning outcomes.},

abstract = {Recent work has confirmed that computing students experience the Imposter Phenomenon (IP) at higher rates than reported in other disciplines. However, no work has examined what aspects of the university computing experience might lead to a higher rate of IP experiences. We aim to illustrate the IP experiences students have, identify common sources of these experiences, and document the effects of these experiences and how students respond to them. We asked undergraduate students to share recent experiences that illustrate their experiences with the IP. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on these open-ended responses, resulting in a set of inter-connected themes. A significant fraction of students related stories about making comparisons with peers or observing peer behaviour that made them question their abilities. Students also spoke about holding unrealistic expectations learned from their peers or imposed by the environment. These experiences may be particularly acute for minority-affiliated students who may come to feel they do not belong. Ultimately, these IP experiences can lead to a loss of motivation or a cycle of failure that leads students to leave computing. The central role social comparisons play in IP experiences suggests that it is particularly important to foster communities where opportunities for comparison are reduced and where realistic expectations are explicitly set.},

abstract = {Motivation Despite the widespread belief that computing practitioners frequently experience the Imposter Phenomenon (IP), little formal work has measured the prevalence of IP in the computing community despite its negative effect on achievement.Objectives This study aims to replicate recent work that has suggested that IP experiences are widespread in computing students and to extend that work by exploring the relationship between the IP, progress in the program, and ethnic identity.Methods A survey with several demographic questions (gender, ethnicity, international status, and year of study) and Clance's IP scale (CIPS) was deployed to students in post-secondary computing courses. Correlations between demographic factors and CIPS scores were evaluated, and a linear model was constructed to explore the interaction between demographic factors of interest.Results We reaffirm that a high proportion of CS students meet the IP diagnostic criteria and that women report higher CIPS scores than men. We also present evidence that Asian students with domestic and international status report different levels of IP experiences.Discussion These findings highlight the importance – to educators at all levels – of cultivating belonging in computing communities.},

abstract = {Peer review is a mainstay of academic publication -- indeed, it is the peer-review process that provides much of the publications' credibility. As the number of computing education conferences and the number of submissions increase, the need for reviewers grows. This report does not attempt to set standards for reviewing; rather, as a first step toward meeting the need for well qualified reviewers, it presents an overview of the ways peer review is used in various venues, both inside computing education and, for comparison, in closely-related areas outside our field. It considers four key components of peer review in some depth: criteria, the review process, roles and responsibilities, and ethics and etiquette. To do so, it draws on relevant literature, guidance and forms associated with peer review, interviews with journal editors and conference chairs, and a limited survey of the computing education research community. In addition to providing an overview of practice, this report identifies a number of themes running through the discourse that have relevance for decision making about how best to conduct peer review for a given venue.},
