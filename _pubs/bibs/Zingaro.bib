abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

abstract = {Motivation: Q&A forums are a critical resource for supporting students in large educational environments, yet students often perceive these forums as stressful and report discomfort in participating visibly, especially in classes that are large and have students with varying levels of prior programming experience (PE). Method: We divided students in a CS1 Q&A forum into smaller, homogenous groups based on their PE. We use a mixed-methods approach to compare data from this experience to data from a setting where all students shared a single, large Q&A forum (a “mixed” setting). We quantitatively analyze measures of student engagement and use an open-ended qualitative approach to examine responses about student experience on the forums. This approach helps us identify the motivation behind student decisions to participate in visible or non-visible ways and to evaluate their alignment with theoretical frameworks. Results: In the mixed setting, students frequently use anonymity, with students without PE using anonymity more than students with PE and women using anonymity more than men. In contrast, in the homogenous groups, novices used anonymity less than novices in the mixed setting, while the students in higher-experience groups tended to use it more. We also observe a reduced anonymity usage among women in the homogenous experience groups, suggesting that PE plays a critical role in the observed gender disparities in forum participation. The qualitative analysis provides additional evidence that social status issues and confidence may explain these behavioral patterns. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential benefits and consequences of grouping students by experience. Homogenous PE groups foster increased student comfort and engagement within the Q&A forum for students with less experience, but students with more experience are exposed to more perceived status threats. We discuss how these results align with the theories we used to design the homogenous group setting. This exploration contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics shaping student behavior in online learning communities. Educators and platform designers can use these lessons to more effectively create inclusive environments that accommodate diverse student needs and preferences.},

abstract = {The recent, widespread availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot may impact introductory programming courses (CS1) both in terms of what should be taught and how to teach it. Indeed, recent research has shown that LLMs are capable of solving the majority of the assignments and exams we previously used in CS1. In addition, professional software engineers are often using these tools, raising the question of whether we should be training our students in their use as well. This experience report describes a CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that fully embraces the use of LLMs from the beginning of the course. To incorporate the LLMs, the course was intentionally altered to reduce emphasis on syntax and writing code from scratch. Instead, the course now emphasizes skills needed to successfully produce software with an LLM. This includes explaining code, testing code, and decomposing large problems into small functions that are solvable by an LLM. In addition to frequent, formative assessments of these skills, students were given three large, open-ended projects in three separate domains (data science, image processing, and game design) that allowed them to showcase their creativity in topics of their choosing. In an end-of-term survey, students reported that they appreciated learning with the assistance of the LLM and that they interacted with the LLM in a variety of ways when writing code. We provide lessons learned for instructors who may wish to incorporate LLMs into their course.},

abstract = { Improving student engagement and learning within introductory Computer Science (CS1) courses has been heavily studied within CS Education (CSE) research due to their fundamental role in a student’s early experiences with learning foundational CS concepts. One issue with many CS1 courses is that the practice of standardized grading leads to limited opportunities for students to find personal relevance within school projects, which could be demotivating for beginner students. This paper examines the impact of incorporating opportunities for creative thinking into a CS1 course through the use of weekly open-ended exercises. Data was collected from 284 students in a CS1 course, where roughly half of the students completed weekly exercises which included an open-ended aspect that allowed them to make their own decisions about their projects. The other half completed similar exercises but with a specifically defined, closed-ended checklist of requirements. Although no effect on academic performance was found, an analysis of survey data collected throughout the course revealed a significant connection between open-ended exercises and increased motivation, especially in terms of confidence and satisfaction. A deeper look at each particular exercise showed variances in how motivating an exercise was based on time in the semester and structure of the exercise, revealing important lessons about the design of effective open-ended CS1 exercises. },
