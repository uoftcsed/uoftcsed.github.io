abstract = {In computer science education, cultivating soft skills alongside technical competencies is increasingly recognized as crucial for successful careers in industry and research. However, integrating soft skills training into curricula often remains a secondary consideration, separate from the primary program delivery or managed by a separate unit within the university. In this paper, we present three comprehensive curricula that intertwine soft skills within academic training for three distinct tiers of computer science education: undergraduate, master's, and professional levels. We identify common intrinsic motivations that we found most impactful for learner success within these programs, and present a detailed exploration of each program's curriculum and goals. By highlighting effective strategies and potential pitfalls, we offer valuable insights into harnessing these motivational drivers to enhance student engagement and learning. Furthermore, we outline emerging opportunities and challenges within the integrated curricula, inviting discussion on the broader implications for computer science education.},

abstract = {Motivation: There is a significant need for diverse voices in research, yet we observed that our CS department’s upper-year research programs were rarely pursued by students from diverse backgrounds. Thus, we developed the PRISM (Preparation for Research through Immersion, Skills, and Mentorship) program at our institution for second- and third-year undergraduate students. Objectives: As this is a new program (offered fully in-person for the first time in 2023), we wanted to measure how well the program fostered feelings of belongingness and self-efficacy in students, and collect general feedback about the program. Methods: Data was collected through online surveys completed at the beginning and end of the program consisting of: (1) scales measuring belongingness and self-efficacy in CS research, (2) open-ended questions about aspects of the program, and (3) a closed-ended question asking for an overall rating. Results: We found that while sense of belonging was not affected by the program, self-efficacy improved statistically significantly from the beginning to the end of the program, and the majority of students enjoyed the program based on their overall rating and positive feedback on the open-ended questions. Implications: The current structure of the program is generally liked by students and had a positive impact on student self-efficacy in CS research. Further research needs to be done on ways to re-structure the program to reach our goal of improving a feeling of belongingness in students.},

abstract = {Recent work has confirmed that computing students experience the Imposter Phenomenon (IP) at higher rates than reported in other disciplines. However, no work has examined what aspects of the university computing experience might lead to a higher rate of IP experiences. We aim to illustrate the IP experiences students have, identify common sources of these experiences, and document the effects of these experiences and how students respond to them. We asked undergraduate students to share recent experiences that illustrate their experiences with the IP. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on these open-ended responses, resulting in a set of inter-connected themes. A significant fraction of students related stories about making comparisons with peers or observing peer behaviour that made them question their abilities. Students also spoke about holding unrealistic expectations learned from their peers or imposed by the environment. These experiences may be particularly acute for minority-affiliated students who may come to feel they do not belong. Ultimately, these IP experiences can lead to a loss of motivation or a cycle of failure that leads students to leave computing. The central role social comparisons play in IP experiences suggests that it is particularly important to foster communities where opportunities for comparison are reduced and where realistic expectations are explicitly set.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present our experience with the use of breakout rooms in a second year undergraduate Software Design course at a large North American institution. Following the switch to remote instruction during the coronavirus pandemic, we revamped our in-person Software Design course to be delivered as a flipped online course, making extensive use of in-lecture exercises completed during breakout rooms. We report on the structure and logistics of this lecture design (for a large class of 300+ students). To gain insights into the impact of the use of breakout rooms on student experience, we conducted weekly student surveys asking for feedback on the lectures and specifically on the use of breakout rooms. Although many students had positive feelings regarding the use of breakout rooms, a significant percentage of students (an average of 47% of the survey responses each week) expressed negative feelings toward them. In an end-of-term survey, we specifically asked students about what they felt worked best for breakout rooms in terms of group size and pre-assigned versus randomized groups, and if there were any other areas that they felt needed improvement. Some of the patterns we observed were that most students liked smaller groups (2-5 people), preferred staying in the same group throughout the semester, and enjoyed the use of breakout rooms as long as others in their room were active participants. We share the details of these survey results as well as the tips and lessons that we learned through this experience.},

abstract = {Motivation Despite the widespread belief that computing practitioners frequently experience the Imposter Phenomenon (IP), little formal work has measured the prevalence of IP in the computing community despite its negative effect on achievement.Objectives This study aims to replicate recent work that has suggested that IP experiences are widespread in computing students and to extend that work by exploring the relationship between the IP, progress in the program, and ethnic identity.Methods A survey with several demographic questions (gender, ethnicity, international status, and year of study) and Clance's IP scale (CIPS) was deployed to students in post-secondary computing courses. Correlations between demographic factors and CIPS scores were evaluated, and a linear model was constructed to explore the interaction between demographic factors of interest.Results We reaffirm that a high proportion of CS students meet the IP diagnostic criteria and that women report higher CIPS scores than men. We also present evidence that Asian students with domestic and international status report different levels of IP experiences.Discussion These findings highlight the importance – to educators at all levels – of cultivating belonging in computing communities.},

abstract = { Improving student engagement and learning within introductory Computer Science (CS1) courses has been heavily studied within CS Education (CSE) research due to their fundamental role in a student’s early experiences with learning foundational CS concepts. One issue with many CS1 courses is that the practice of standardized grading leads to limited opportunities for students to find personal relevance within school projects, which could be demotivating for beginner students. This paper examines the impact of incorporating opportunities for creative thinking into a CS1 course through the use of weekly open-ended exercises. Data was collected from 284 students in a CS1 course, where roughly half of the students completed weekly exercises which included an open-ended aspect that allowed them to make their own decisions about their projects. The other half completed similar exercises but with a specifically defined, closed-ended checklist of requirements. Although no effect on academic performance was found, an analysis of survey data collected throughout the course revealed a significant connection between open-ended exercises and increased motivation, especially in terms of confidence and satisfaction. A deeper look at each particular exercise showed variances in how motivating an exercise was based on time in the semester and structure of the exercise, revealing important lessons about the design of effective open-ended CS1 exercises. },
