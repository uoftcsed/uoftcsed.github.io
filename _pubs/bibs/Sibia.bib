abstract = {Motivation: CS2 students often struggle to connect low-level memory operations with high-level structural understanding, particularly with recursion and linked data structures. Visualizations can aid learning by making underlying relationships more visible and helping students track complex behavior. While such tools exist, most emphasize procedural flow without scaffolding abstraction. We explore whether multiple external representations (MERs), which are a well-established approach in other STEM fields that is underutilized in computing education, can support structural abstraction through synchronized, layered visualizations.Method: We used a tri-pane interface, grounded in Ainsworth’s DeFT framework, as a design probe. The system synchronized source code, memory diagrams, and abstract structural views. It was embedded into a 12-week CS2 course (n = 695) focused on recursive, reference-based structures. Students engaged with three MER-aligned activities during the semester. 440 completed an end-of-term survey, and 301 provided open-ended feedback. We analyzed perceived clarity, usability, and mental effort using validated scales and thematic coding.Results: Students described the MER visualizations as clear, intuitive, and helpful, especially for recursion and pointer-heavy logic. Many said the integration of views supported “seeing the bigger picture” and reduced reliance on rote tracing. Usability ratings were strong, mental effort was moderate, and non-native English speakers reported higher clarity than native speakers.Implications: As an initial exploration, these findings offer early empirical grounding for the further use of MERs in CS2. The work surfaces representational affordances, learner strategies, and design tensions that can inform future tools and evaluations of abstraction support in computing education.},

abstract = {This research evaluates voice-based self-explanations as a pedagogical tool in preparation for lectures, assesses user preferences between voice and text, and derives design insights. We report two studies: Study 1, a quasi-experimental field study, with 247 participants divided into voice-based (N = 83), text-based (N = 81), and choice (N = 83) conditions. Study 2 uses semi-structured interviews (N = 16) to explore perceptions of the interaction paradigms in-depth. Results from the first study revealed a general preference for text, though voice users produced longer responses and more topic-related keywords. Over time, the preference for voice increased among students, from 10\% to 46\%, when given a choice. Study 2 suggested that factors like social presence contribute to hesitance toward voice-based explanations, with a cognitive load, self-confidence, and performance anxiety also influencing medium preferences. Our findings highlight design recommendations and demonstrate the potential of voice-based self-explanations in educational settings, indicating that mixed interfaces might better meet diverse needs.},

abstract = {Self-explanations show promise for engaging students with preparatory materials, yet research into the types of self-explanations submitted in computing is limited. This paper examines student perceptions of self-explanation prompts in a flipped databases course, building on existing research that highlights the advantages of self-explanations in such contexts. We present our findings on students’ perceptions of the utility of self-explanation prompts and analyze the nature of the explanations generated across distinct topics. The results suggest that self-explanations not only facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter but also promote the discovery of new connections and examples through rewording explanations. Furthermore, errors within self-explanations offer valuable insights for the early identification of misconceptions.},

abstract = {Evidence-based strategies suggest ways to reduce the gender gap in computing. For example, elective classes are valuable in enabling students to choose in which directions to expand their computing knowledge in areas aligned with their interests. The availability of electives of interest may also make computing programs of study more meaningful to women. However, research on which elective computing topics are more appealing to women is often class or institution specific. In this study, we investigate differences in enrollment within undergraduate-level elective classes in computing to study differences between women and men. The study combined data from nine institutions from both Western Europe and North America and included 272 different classes with 49,710 student enrollments. These classes were encoded using ACM curriculum guidelines and combined with the enrollment data to build a hierarchical statistical model of factors affecting student choice. Our model shows which elective topics are less popular with all students (including fundamentals of programming languages and parallel and distributed computing), and which elective topics are more popular with women students (including mathematical and statistical foundations, human computer interaction and society, ethics, and professionalism). Understanding which classes appeal to different students can help departments gain insight of student choices and develop programs accordingly. Additionally, these choices can also help departments explore whether some students are less likely to choose certain classes than others, indicating potential barriers to participation in computing.},
