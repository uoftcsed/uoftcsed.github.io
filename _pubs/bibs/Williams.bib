abstract = {This research evaluates voice-based self-explanations as a pedagogical tool in preparation for lectures, assesses user preferences between voice and text, and derives design insights. We report two studies: Study 1, a quasi-experimental field study, with 247 participants divided into voice-based (N = 83), text-based (N = 81), and choice (N = 83) conditions. Study 2 uses semi-structured interviews (N = 16) to explore perceptions of the interaction paradigms in-depth. Results from the first study revealed a general preference for text, though voice users produced longer responses and more topic-related keywords. Over time, the preference for voice increased among students, from 10\% to 46\%, when given a choice. Study 2 suggested that factors like social presence contribute to hesitance toward voice-based explanations, with a cognitive load, self-confidence, and performance anxiety also influencing medium preferences. Our findings highlight design recommendations and demonstrate the potential of voice-based self-explanations in educational settings, indicating that mixed interfaces might better meet diverse needs.},

This paper examines student perceptions of self-explanation prompts in a flipped databases course, building on existing research that highlights the advantages of self-explanations in such contexts. We present our findings on students’ perceptions of the utility of self-explanation prompts and analyze
the nature of the explanations generated across distinct topics. The results suggest that self-explanations not only facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter but also promote the discovery of new connections and examples through rewording explanations. Furthermore, errors within self-explanations offer valuable insights for the early identification of misconceptions.},

abstract = {Randomized A/B comparisons of alternative pedagogical strategies or other course improvements could provide useful empirical evidence for instructor decision-making. However, traditional experiments do not provide a straightforward pathway to rapidly utilize data, increasing the chances that students in an experiment experience the best conditions. Drawing inspiration from the use of machine learning and experimentation in product development at leading technology companies, we explore how adaptive experimentation might aid continuous course improvement. In adaptive experiments, data is analyzed and utilized as different conditions are deployed to students. This can be achieved using machine learning algorithms to identify which actions are more beneficial in improving students’ learning experiences and outcomes. These algorithms can then dynamically deploy the most effective conditions in subsequent interactions with students, resulting in better support for students’ needs. We illustrate this approach with a case study that provides a side-by-side comparison of traditional and adaptive experiments on adding self-explanation prompts in online homework problems in a CS1 course. This work paves the way for exploring the importance of adaptive experiments in bridging research and practice to achieve continuous improvement in educational settings.},

abstract = {In computing courses, instructor involvement and social comfort are vital for resilience and belonging. We examine engagement with instructor emails aimed at strengthening the connection with students. We sent weekly emails from instructors to first- and upper-year computing students. These emails included reminders for the assignments due each week. Half of the students received reminders embedded in an informal message that contained approachable wording and relevant current course events, while the rest received a list of precise deadlines. This text had no emotional engagement from the instructor. We collected and analyzed email access and link click rates, along with student survey responses about email preferences and engagement. We found that first-year students had lower email access and link click rates than upper-year students. While we did not find differences in first-year engagement based on the type of email, upper-year students appeared to be more engaged when receiving the intentionally informal version of the email. Understanding the message preferences of computing students can enhance instructor messaging and improve engagement. Strategies should be explored to boost first-year student engagement, while the higher engagement among upper-year students underscores the importance of instructor support in advanced courses.},

Using Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT), we investigate their major intentions and the impact of these factors post-CS1. Data was gathered using surveys at the beginning and end of an introductory programming course, focusing on demographics, expectations of success, and perceptions of challenges. Application status for the computing major was also recorded. Our results revealed that men and students with PE generally perceived greater potential for success and reported facing fewer challenges. In contrast, women and students without PE more often indicated concerns about intellectual ability and perceived challenges less positively. Notably, while gender appears in the preceding results, an intersectional analysis indicates that PE is the central factor. PE is also linked to persistence in the field of computing. Our results further highlight the importance of providing students with opportunities to develop experience, as it can help shape their expectations, perceived challenges, and retention in computing.},

abstract = {Email is an important mode of communication because it scales to the largest computing courses and is institutionally supported. Furthermore, regular email communication from instructors has been shown to help set student expectations and encourage participation. As a result, effective email can contribute to emotional engagement, which has been linked to improvements in performance and retention, the latter being a persistent problem in computer science. However, we lack a clear picture of how computing students interact with emails and whether their use aligns with instructors’ expectations. This paper addresses this gap by presenting data on how often CS1 students open instructor emails. We present email engagement data throughout the term for a particular type of email that prompts students to plan to start their homework. Contrary to instructors’ expectations, the rate at which students open emails of this kind does not change significantly over the term. Many students who engage with the emails do so consistently, even after repeated emails throughout the term. The patterns we found illustrate the value of collecting this type of data and informing instructors and researchers about who reads these messages and how often they actually reach students.},

abstract = {Q\&A forums are widely used in large classes to provide scalable support. In addition to offering students a space to ask questions, these forums aim to create a community and promote engagement. Prior literature suggests that the way students participate in Q\&A forums varies and that most students do not actively post questions or engage in discussions. Students may display different participation behaviours depending on their comfort levels in the class. This paper investigates students' use of a Q\&A forum in a CS1 course. We also analyze student opinions about the forum to explain the observed behaviour, focusing on students' lack of visible participation (lurking, anonymity, private posting). We analyzed forum data collected in a CS1 course across two consecutive years and invited students to complete a survey about perspectives on their forum usage. Despite a small cohort of highly engaged students, we confirmed that most students do not actively read or post on the forum. We discuss students' reasons for the low level of engagement and barriers to participating visibly. Common reasons include fearing a lack of knowledge and repercussions from being visible to the student community.},

abstract = {Post-secondary institutions have experienced a continuous trend of student procrastination on course work, thus leading to lower academic performance and potentially worse knowledge retention and other longer-term impacts. Sending reminders about deliverables is a simple approach, but it has the potential to be a valuable tool to mitigate such issues and assist students with time management. This paper will introduce specific processes of conducting such experiments, especially email designs and randomization, to help instructors and researchers conduct similar experiments or field-deploying reminders. To evaluate homework reminder messages, we designed and deployed a real-world randomized A/B experiment at a North American university in a CS1 course where students were randomly assigned to either receive these reminder messages or not. Our findings suggest that students who received the reminder messages have a higher homework completion rate (p &lt; .05) and performed significantly better (p &lt; .01) on the following midterm test than students who did not receive the reminder message. Finally, we discuss how a homework reminder can improve student behaviours, as well as how this type of reminder can be enhanced for future interventions.},

This paper explores the design space of using emails to get students to plan and reflect on starting weekly homework earlier. We deployed a series of email reminders using randomized A/B comparisons to test alternative factors in the design of these emails, providing examples of an experimental paradigm and metrics for a broader range of interventions. We also surveyed and interviewed instructors and students to compare their predictions about the effectiveness of the reminders with their actual impact. We present our results on which seemingly obvious predictions about effective emails are not borne out, despite there being evidence for further exploring these interventions, as they can sometimes motivate students to attempt their homework more often. We also present qualitative evidence about student opinions and behaviours after receiving the emails, to guide further interventions. These findings provide insight into how to use randomized A/B comparisons in everyday channels such as emails, to provide empirical evidence to test our beliefs about the effectiveness of alternative design choices. },

abstract="Adaptive experiments can increase the chance that current students obtain better outcomes from a field experiment of an instructional intervention. In such experiments, the probability of assigning students to conditions changes while more data is being collected, so students can be assigned to interventions that are likely to perform better. Digital educational environments lower the barrier to conducting such adaptive experiments, but they are rarely applied in education. One reason might be that researchers have access to few real-world case studies that illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of these experiments in a specific context. We evaluate the effect of homework email reminders in students by conducting an adaptive experiment using the Thompson Sampling algorithm and compare it to a traditional uniform random experiment. We present this as a case study on how to conduct such experiments, and we raise a range of open questions about the conditions under which adaptive randomized experiments may be more or less useful.",

In this paper, we present CodeChecker, a system which generates hints automatically using student data, and incorporates them into an existing CS1 online homework environment, used by over 1000 students per semester. We present insights from survey and interview data, about student and instructor perceptions of the system.

We show how modular components of any educational interface - e.g. explanations, homework problems, even emails - can be implemented using the novel MOOClet software architecture. Researchers and instructors can use these augmented MOOClet components for: (1) Iterative Cycles of Randomized Experiments that test alternative versions of course content; (2) Data-Driven Improvement using adaptive experiments that rapidly use data to give better versions of content to future students, on the order of days rather than months. A MOOClet supports both manual and automated improvement using reinforcement learning; (3) Personalization by delivering alternative versions as a function of data about a student's characteristics or subgroup, using both expert-authored rules and data mining algorithms. We provide an open-source web service for implementing MOOClets (www.mooclet.org) that has been used with thousands of students. The MOOClet framework provides an ecosystem that transforms online course components into collaborative micro-laboratories, where instructors, experimental researchers, and data mining/machine learning researchers can engage in perpetual cycles of experimentation, improvement, and personalization.},

abstract = {Procrastination by students may lead to adverse outcomes such as a focus on completion rather than learning or even a failure to complete learning tasks. One common method for motivating students and reducing procrastination is to send reminders with hints and study strategies, but it's not clear if these messages are effective or when is the best time to send them. Randomized A/B comparisons could be used to try different reminders or alternative ideas about how best to get students to start work earlier and, crucially, to measure the impact of these interventions on behaviour. This paper describes an A/B comparison of reminder emails set in a large CS1 course at a research-focused North American university. We found evidence that the email interventions caused a higher proportion of students to attempt the online homework but did not see evidence that these particular emails got students to start early, irrespective of changes to the timing of the reminder. More broadly, these findings illustrate how to use A/B comparisons in educational settings to test ideas about how to help students, and demonstrate the value of using randomized A/B comparisons, even when evaluating actions that seem obviously beneficial, such as reminder emails.},

Many instructors use online systems to deliver new course content and exercises, but students often delay assignments or game these systems (e.g., guessing on multiple-choice questions), often to the detriment of their learning. In an inverted CS1 course, many students self-reported high rates of gaming-the-system behavior, so we examine survey data to identify factors that contribute to engagement in these maladaptive behaviours. We supplement that analysis with interview data to gain a deeper understanding of the situation. We also implemented and evaluated a previously reported online intervention aimed at reducing gaming behavior. Unlike prior work, our intervention did not have a significant effect on guessing behavior. We discuss why the factors we identified might explain this result, as well as suggest future work to improve our understanding of gaming behaviours and inform the design of systems that encourage effective learning.},
