abstract = {Email is an important mode of communication because it scales to the largest computing courses and is institutionally supported. Furthermore, regular email communication from instructors has been shown to help set student expectations and encourage participation. As a result, effective email can contribute to emotional engagement, which has been linked to improvements in performance and retention, the latter being a persistent problem in computer science. However, we lack a clear picture of how computing students interact with emails and whether their use aligns with instructors’ expectations. This paper addresses this gap by presenting data on how often CS1 students open instructor emails. We present email engagement data throughout the term for a particular type of email that prompts students to plan to start their homework. Contrary to instructors’ expectations, the rate at which students open emails of this kind does not change significantly over the term. Many students who engage with the emails do so consistently, even after repeated emails throughout the term. The patterns we found illustrate the value of collecting this type of data and informing instructors and researchers about who reads these messages and how often they actually reach students.},

abstract = {Motivation and Objectives. Productive Failure is a problem-based learning technique where students attempt to solve a problem before receiving instruction in the topic. By design, students may not find a satisfying solution. Prior studies of Productive Failure in STEM contexts have been conducted in secondary or introductory college settings. Focusing primarily on exploring appropriate analysis and modeling techniques, these studies showed that a Productive Failure approach can lead to greater conceptual knowledge acquisition and transfer capabilities compared to »traditional«Direct Instruction techniques. In this study, we build on these studies along two dimensions: First, we report on the design and evaluation of a Productive Failure intervention in a more advanced undergraduate class: third-year Operating Systems. Second, our intervention targeted a more advanced skill: applying synchronization primitives, rather than selecting appropriate modeling and analysis techniques. Methods. We ran a quasi-experimental study in an undergraduate Operating Systems course to compare the effects of Productive Failure (PF) with Direct Instruction (DI) on students’ learning. To ensure fidelity of implementation as well as to explore different modes of instruction, we ran a pilot study in a remote learning environment. The final study was conducted in an in-person classroom environment. We collected and analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data to gather insights into the students’ problem-solving process and learning outcomes. Results. In line with previous studies, our study did not provide empirical evidence that there was any statistically significant difference with respect to reflection or short-term transfer. While we were able to verify that students in the Productive Failure condition explored a wider spectrum of solution approaches, we could not reliably detect different communication patterns across the conditions. Finally and unlike previous studies, our study was unable to detect longer-term difference in transfer capabilities. Discussion. We failed to observe several of the advantages of Productive Failure over Direct Instruction seen in prior work in other contexts. However, we note several differences in context relative to those earlier studies, including both the complexity of the topics covered and the type of intended learning outcomes. Consequently, our results do not directly contradict earlier findings. Still, they leave room for interpretation and call for further investigation of this instructional approach in more advanced computer science classes.},

abstract = {Writing skills are often considered unimportant by computer science students and were under-emphasized in our curriculum. We describe our experience embedding CS-specific writing instruction at scale in most of our large, core, first- and second-year Computer Science courses, each with 300-800+ students. Our approach is to collaborate with a writing specialist and a community of course instructors, centralize the management of writing teaching assistants, and introduce a variety of relevant genres and contexts to help students develop and apply writing skills. We outline the institutional support and organization crucial to a project of this scale. In addition, we report on a survey collecting student perception of the writing instruction/assessment. We reflect on quantitative and qualitative evidence of success, as well as the challenges that we faced. We believe that many of these challenges will be common across institutions, parti
cularly those with large courses.},

abstract = {This study analyzes common issues in the writing of our upper-year, undergraduate computer science students in timed (e.g. tests) and untimed (e.g. longer assignment reports) scenarios. Our goal is to identify writing issues that should be addressed earlier in the CS curriculum. In collaboration with a writing specialist, we develop and fine-tune a rubric with Grammar, Conciseness, Clarity, Organization, Structure, and Formality as the main categories.  We find, in our writing samples, that grammatical issues (such as punctuation errors or run-on sentences) are common even in a setting where students have ample time to proofread. Other common issues include unclear pronoun antecedents, lacking topic sentences, and other structural and organizational issues. Moreover, we correlate the presence of these issues with the students' grades. We do not find statistically significant correlations between writing skill and grades, and the weak correlations we find depend heavily on the writing context.  We hope that our rubric items and findings are useful for instructors in targeting writing skills that warrant development.},

abstract = {With the shift to online delivery, instructors looked to provide comparable help supports for students, especially for first-year learners who need timely assistance the most. Our work aims to understand student help seeking behavior and perception of getting help in an online CS2 course.First, we analyze how much students ask for help and perceive to get help in several help support components: lectures, labs, instructor office hours, and on the discussion board. We find that while students take advantage of all help resources, the discussion board is predominantly the main source of help, while instructor office hours run into scalability problems. Secondly, we explore whether asking for and getting help are correlated with grades and find an inverted-U quadratic relationship in both cases. This indicates that low-performing and high-performing students ask for the least help and perceive to get the least help in each of the help support components. Finally, in each help context, we investigate which categories of questions students seek help the most with, and who students rely on most for help.Our analysis is intended to help educators better understand how to support first-year students in an online course and we hope that our findings are also useful for help support planning once in-person learning resumes.},

abstract = {Most active learning methods aim to engage students in collaborative problem-solving. While active learning and collaboration benefits are indisputable, more investigation is needed to understand student engagement in group activities. This qualitative study investigates the student perspective on group work in a CS2 inverted classroom, to better understand the learner mindset and identify potential barriers or conduits for collaborative engagement. We conducted 30-45 minute interviews with 30 participants from six sections of CS2, with five sections being scheduled in an Active Learning Classroom (ALC) and one in a traditional lecture hall, all taught in the same inverted model and using the same in-class activities. A multitude of facets of student behavior or engagement in group work and interactions with peers were identified via emergent coding. We classified emerging themes into higher-order categories which subsume semantically-related themes, forming a hierarchy with the top-level categories being Perceived Utility and Social Environment. This classification is intended to provide insight to educators seeking to better engage students in active learning via collaborative in-class activities.},
